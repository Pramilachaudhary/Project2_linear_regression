# Domestic Revenue Prediction Model for Movies
Pramila Chaudhary
# Abstract
The purpose behind this project is to create a prediction model that determines the total domestic revenue for a movie. 
In order to select the perfect model I selected features which had strong relation ship with the other features and with the target variable. 
Trained the data over Linear regression and Lasso regression and determined the score values to find the best model for  final test data

# Design
The owner of an investment firm wants to invest in movies and needed help in predicting the Domestic revenue for a movie.

# Data Set
  1070 data point from website : https://www.boxofficemojo.com

# Algorithms
  1. web scraping : using Beautiful soup.
  2. Data cleaning: Removed non required columns, records with missing values, null values, duplicate rows.
  3. Feature engineering: added dummies for each column with multiple values.
  4. EDA: Did data visualization get the better idea on feature selection.
  5. Regression Analysis: linear regression and Lasso is used to train/validate the data set and calculated the r2 and MSE score for each model.
  6. prediction: found the best model and predicted Gross Domestic revenue(Target).


# Tools
Python: Defing functions
Pandas, Numpy, Beautiful soup, Scikit-learn 
Seaborn/Matplotlib: For data visualization
