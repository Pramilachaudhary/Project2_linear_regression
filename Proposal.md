# Linear_Regression Project Proposal

**1. What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?**

 The goal of this project is to build a model to predict total domestic profit percentage for a movie.

**2. Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?**

The owner of an investment firm wants to invest in movies and needed help in predicting the total profit perfectage for a movie. 

**3. What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?**
