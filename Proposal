# Linear_Regression Project Proposal

**What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?**

 The goal of this project is to build a model to predict total domestic profit percentage for a movie.

**Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?**

The owner of an investment firm wants to invest in movies and needed help in predicting the total profit perfectage for a movie. 

**What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?**
scraping out data from https://www.boxofficemojo.com

--using BeatifulSoup Python Library

**What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?**

Features that are included in this analysis would be:
movie titile, distributor, opening,release date, MPAA,

**If modeling, what will you predict as your target?**
I am planning to target the maximum number of morning commuters between (8am to 10am) on weekdays at a specific station in order to increase the sales.

**Tools:**


**MVP Goal:**
My goal is to find at most 8 busiest stations in the morning hours on weekdays.


The goal of this project was to investigate the features that contribute to higher revenues for science fiction films. 
I scraped data from IMDb, BoxOfficeMojo, and TheNumbers, ending up with information about the revenues, actors, directors, 
runtime, MPAA ratings, release dates, and plot keywords for 1700 films. I originally wanted to see if there was a relationship 
between the number of ‘tropes’ (which I extracted from plot keywords in IMDb) in the film and revenue. I was hoping to see more 
defined linear relationships between the features and the target (revenue), but I was still able to identify some of the important 
features using random forest regression. I started with pretty low R squared scores, and after some engineering, cleaning, and scaling, 
ended up with a score up to 0.76. Overall, my data indicated that the actors and directors are the most important features when considering 
higher revenues for sci-fi films.
